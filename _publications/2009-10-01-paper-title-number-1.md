ABSTRACT

With the development of digital transformation, the dynamics between retail landscapes and consumer behavior have shifted profoundly. The Metaverse's ascent has further blurred digital and physical realms, revolutionizing shopping experiences. This paper, through an exhaustive literature review, delves into the nuanced impact of cognitive emotions on consumer preferences in the Metaverse by developing a cognition-emotion framework. It also explores the role and impact of digital touchpoints in phygital retailing. The study shows that, as the first digital natives, millennials merge immersive digital experiences with tangible ones, showing distinct touchpoint preferences. Drawing from these insights, this study illuminates how digital touchpoints bridge retailers to consumers and underscores the evolving Metaverse research in retail, guiding retailers to cater to millennial needs adeptly.
